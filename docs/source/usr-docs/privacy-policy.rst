Privacy Policy
===================================

**Last updated 4/24/2018**


This page is intended to inform the user of Whitman Books Online's policies concerning the collection, use, and distribution to third parties of personal information. 

Information Collection
======================
To put it simply, our project is not sophisticated enough to do much fancy data collection. We collect the email address, name, and profile picture of a user and obviously the books a user is selling. If we didn't collect this information, the webapp wouldn't work properly. The books a user sells are stored in our database and most of the rest is stored in the user's local browser. 

Log Data
========
We do not currently collect *any* log data (such as a user's ip address, browser and operating system, etc.) 

Cookies
=======

We do not use cookies. Simple as that.

Security
========

We do our best to keep user data private. That said, no method of communication over the internet is perfect, and perfect security does not exist. We will not falsely proclaim that our app is "hacker proof," and in using our app, the user does assume *some* risk, just as with any other platform. However, as mentioned above, we do not store any highly confidential information anyway, so there's not much for a potential hacker to steal. 

Changes to the Privacy Policy
=============================

This privacy policy may be updated at some future point in time, and the user should assume that any changes to the privacy policy will be in effect *as soon as the policy is updated.* Therefore, it is the *user's responsibility* to check the privacy policy page periodically. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time with or without actively incorming users, and in using our service, the user consents to and takes responsibility for being informed of our privacy policy. We do not anticipate any large changes to the privacy policy to be made, but if there are we will do our best to let the user know.

==========
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to contact davisjf@whitman.edu. Have a nice day!
